👋 Hi, I’m **@e65ce0a5-wordle** and I’m a standalone fork of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish) and you can play me [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/)

You can import your existing **Wordle** history to me by following the instructions [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/migrate.html)

## How to Play Me

You have **6** guesses to solve my puzzle word.
Each guess must be any five-letter word known to me.

After submitting your guess by hitting the enter key, the letter tiles will turn either gray⬛, green🟩, or yellow🟨.

- Gray⬛: The letter is incorrect.
- Green🟩: The letter is correct, and in the correct position.
- Yellow🟨: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.

You can replay previously unsolved puzzles by clicking on the **#** puzzle number found on the bottom right of the settings page.

And if you’re so inclined, you may also play my “Eighth Avenue” cousin [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/4d41d2be.html)
