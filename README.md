ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @e65ce0a5-wordle and Iâ€™m a standalone archive of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish) and you can play me [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/)

You can import your existing Wordle history to me by following the instructions [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/migrate.html)

## How to Play Me

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.

You can replay previously unsolved puzzles by clicking on the puzzle number found on the bottom right of the settings page.

And if you really must, you can play my Eighth Avenue cousin [here](https://e65ce0a5-wordle.github.io/e65ce0a5-wordle/4d41d2be.html)
